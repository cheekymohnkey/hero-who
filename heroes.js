There is no discernible mouth, only the hollow emptiness where their features would be. Their skeletal hands are elongated and appear to fade into the air itself, with fingers that seem to dissipate like smoke when not in use. Their movements are fluid and unnatural, gliding effortlessly as they phase through solid objects or disappear from sight.

They tend to act alone, preferring solitude and the quiet of darkness, but they are not indifferent to those who share their ideals or seek their aid.

    "personality": "Zian is a fiercely independent and enigmatic hero, preferring solitude in the untamed skies but always watching over those in need. They are intelligent and strategic, relying on their sharp mind as much as their physical prowess to outwit and overpower opponents. Though they can come across as aloof, Zian’s heart is fiercely loyal to the innocent and oppressed. They value freedom above all else and fight to protect it, believing that everyone deserves to soar without chains. Zian is wary of forming attachments but will risk everything to safeguard those they deem worthy of their protection.",

    "background": "Born of both sky and storm, Zian was created by elemental forces to maintain balance in the heavens. They grew up roaming wild and free, learning to harness the power of lightning and the ferocity of the winds. Legends say they emerged from a great storm that swept across the land, their first cry echoing like a clap of thunder. As they matured, Zian became a guardian of the skies, warding off those who sought to harm the natural world or disrupt the balance of the elements. Their isolation fostered a strong sense of independence, but they couldn’t ignore the cries of the innocent below, leading them to descend from the clouds to fight injustice. Now, Zian is both a protector and a symbol of the storm’s might—a reminder that even in chaos, there is beauty and purpose.",
