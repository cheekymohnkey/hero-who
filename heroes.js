Their bat-like wings are large and lined with faint, lightning-like patterns that pulse and crackle with electric energy, especially when in motion. These wings shimmer faintly under light, adding an almost ethereal quality to their presence. Mantibolt’s scorpion-like tail is tipped with a glowing stinger that crackles with energy, constantly shifting between shades of electric blue and white-hot yellow. The tail moves with precision, ready to strike at a moment’s notice. Every part of Mantibolt’s design reflects their connection to storms and lightning, from their electrified tail to the faint hum of static that surrounds them when they’re poised for action."

Though Wraithkin’s motivations are primarily driven by the desire to aid and guide lost souls, they also harbor a deep disdain for evil and injustice. Their ghostly nature reflects their otherworldly perspective—while they respect the living, they are not bound by the same rules and moralities, often operating with a more pragmatic, ruthless edge when it comes to confronting evil. They tend to act alone, preferring solitude and the quiet of darkness, but they are not indifferent to those who share their ideals or seek their aid. Despite their cold exterior, Wraithkin carries a deep sorrow within them, a sadness borne from the knowledge of their own existence as a being stuck between worlds. They are constantly searching for meaning in their existence, often questioning their role in the grand design of life and death.",

They are a guardian to those souls who are lost, trapped in the spaces between life and the afterlife. Their role is to ensure that the souls of the deceased are either guided to peace or protected from the evils that lurk in the shadows of the afterlife. Though they serve the dead, Wraithkin also has a personal mission: to understand their own existence and purpose. They seek to unravel the mystery of how they came to be and what their true mission is in the grand scheme of the universe.
